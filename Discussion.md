## Solutions Considered
1. Using simple file reading with `open()`
2. Using `grep` for fast extraction (Linux-based)
3. Using memory-mapped files for efficiency

## Final Solution Summary
We used Python's built-in file handling to efficiently process logs while optimizing memory usage.

## Steps to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed (`python --version`).
2. Run the script with:
